### Expertise
- No, I have never developed an R package

### Expertise
- I want to develop a new package. Describe your project in a maximum of 200 words.

The Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), initiated in 2009, is Taiwan's first long-term, nationwide avian survey initiative, supported by governmental and conservation agencies. Despite its 14-year span, this valuable dataset remains underutilized due to challenges in data retrieval and barriers in statistical modeling. In the rOpenSci champions program, I will develop 'bbsTrim', a package to streamline Taiwan BBS data retrieval and analysis. 'bbsTrim' will support data retrieval from GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. 'bbsTrim' will also include the population trend modelling, using TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data). Users can tailor species analysis, controlling data stratification, preparation, and modeling. I will be consulting the Taiwan BBS team to ensure that the 'bbsTrim' package is using the methods as the official products. As an R package, 'bbsTrim' can easily be integrated into other R programming processes. The goal is to expand Taiwan BBS data access to the broader R-society in Taiwan.



### Motivation
#### Why would you like to be part of the rOpenSci champions program? Please respond in a maximum of 200 words.

I attended a workshop at an ornithology conference where I learned about an R package 'bbsBayes2'. This package uses North American Breeding Bird Survey data for status and trend analysis. I felt inspired and realized how beneficial it would be to have a similar R package tailored to BBS data in Taiwan, my home country. Coincidentally, I met a staff member from rOpenSci at the same conference, and she introduced me to the rOpenSci champions program. I saw this as a perfect opportunity because: 1) I can receive assistance and support in developing the R package I'm passionate about, 2) this package will greatly assist people in Taiwan who want to use BBS data, and 3) as my future career goal is to become an R data scientist, being involved in rOpenSci will significantly enhance my learning and networking in open source software community.


#### How do you expect your role as a rOpenSci Champion will inform or support your local community? Please respond in a maximum of 200 words.

I worked at the Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute, a government organization responsible for managing the majority of the nation's biodiversity dataset. During my time there, I noticed a deficiency in skills related to data management, data wrangling, and data distribution within the Taiwan BBS dataset. The practical interoperability and reusability of the data remain barriers for many individuals. Therefore, developing a tool that streamlines data retrieval, wrangling, and modeling would greatly enhance the utilization of this invaluable dataset for 1) government researchers for nationwide biodiversity evaluation reports, 2) university researchers and students for scientific studies, and 3) the general public for enhancing the experience in participating volunteer survey. Collaborating closely with the Taiwan BBS team, I will be promoting the package utilization upon completion.



#### What are three things that you consider to be most important to do or keep in mind when participating in a community of practice like rOpenSci? Please, explain in a maximum of 400 words.

1. **Open Collaboration:** Engage in open collaboration by sharing the work, tools, products, and insights. Contribute to open-source projects, such as publishing code on GitHub and sharing data on GBIF. These will help create a culture of sharing.

2. **Active Engagement:** Actively participate in discussions, events, and outreach activities. Within the community, share knowledge and ideas actively. Outside the community, consider organizing workshops and tutorials to promote tool usage and establish connections.

3. **Sustainable Learning:** Be open to communicate when encountering challenges. At the same time, be willing to provide assistance when opportunities arise, such as acting as being a mentor. These will contribute to a healthy learning environment where knowledge is shared within the community.

#### Please indicate how your current employment status gives you the flexibility to dedicate time to fulfilling the responsibilities of the rOpenSci Champion Program. The estimated time commitment for each Champion is, on average, 16 hours per month (includes trainings, cohort events, mentoring meetings, package development or review process, and preparing for and hosting events). The total time commitment for each Champion will vary based on the path and activities they choose to do during the program. Please respond in a maximum of 200 words

As a PhD student, my workloads vary based on semesters. My primary tasks during the 2023 fall semester (Sep - Dec) include teaching (~20 hr/week), tutoring (~5 hr/week), and thesis-related work (~10 hr/week). My schedule is more flexible in the 2024 winter semester (Jan - Apr): tutoring (~5 hr/week) and thesis-related work (~20 hr/week). This schedule aligns well with the rOpenSci Champion Program, where the main activities (training sessions, mentoring meetings, project development) occur from January to April 2024, along with the subsequent summer (outreach activities, mentoring and cohort meetings, project development). I plan to allocate ~5 hr/week during this period for the rOpenSci Champion Program.
